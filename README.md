This is a small module to add alternative rules for Exhaustion in the dnd5e system. When the module is enabled, exhaustion will have 10 levels instead of 6, and it will not cause the default effects such as halved or limited movement.

# Setup
Head into the module settings and decide whether you want to manually apply the attribute in actors' Special Traits.

If enabled (which is recommended), apply these in your actors' Special Traits menu.

If disabled, make sure to simply *not* do the above in Special Traits.
